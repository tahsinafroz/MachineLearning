<h1>Blackspot Analysis using Machine Learning</h1>

<h2>Project Title: Predictive Analysis of Road Accident Blackspots using Machine Learning</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
This project focuses on identifying and analyzing road accident blackspots using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The objective is to develope a predictive model that classifies accident-prone areas (blackspots) based on demographic, road infrastructure, and environmental factors. The is aligned with hypothetical case study of VicCrashAnalytics and the Department of Transport (DOT), aiming to enhance public safety and optimize resource allocation for road safety interventions.

Python

<h3>Machine Learning Approach:</h3>

**Algorithm Used**: Logistic Regression (a classification model)<br />
**Data Splitting**: 80% Training | 20% Testing <br />
**Feature Selection**: Forward Feature Selection method <br />
**Model Evaluation**:<br />
*Accuracy*: 92.3%<br />
*F1-score*: 95% (non-blackspots), 46% (blackspots)<br />
*ROC Curve*: Showed high predictive power in blackspot identification.<br />
